Added last band write file so next reboot will set amplifier were it was last time
Rebuilt entire Band selection toggle buttons 
Implemented Efficiecy computation so if less than 65 % , the amplifier will auto shutdown 50V voltage rail (WiP)
Disabled 15 and 10 meter band until Transmission line Transformers or output filters are to be rebuild (poor efficiency here )
